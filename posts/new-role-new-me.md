# A year ago, I decided to switch jobs and join a new company. In this article, I’ll share how this change has affected my career and what I’ve learned from the experience so far.

## Stepping into the newness

First, let me be clear about my intention in writing this piece: it’s not meant to throw shade at my current situation, express regret, or even give direct advice. Simply put, it’s a story about change (with all its perks and downsides) so please read it in that light.  

Now, let me explain why this opportunity was so new to me in almost every way. This was my first time joining an outsourcing company, and I was outsourced to a large, well-established government organization (corporate level). That meant everything was clearly defined and well-structured, including my role, responsibilities, and what came from management. Within a short time, you knew exactly what you could and couldn’t do (a basic corporate system), but one that was entirely new to me as I had never worked in such an environment before.  

The **SDLC** there was also new to me. Everything starting from very strict business requirements that left little to no room for discussion or brainstorming (except in cases involving technical limitations) was highly structured. The Jira setup was also different, focusing more on team productivity through all sorts of charts, rather than tracking each team member individually. For example, Each member didn't have a dedicated board, so no individual tracking for each one to be discussed in stand-ups and sprint reviews.  

It was also my first time working with a dedicated QC and automation team. Speaking of sprint reviews, most of the showcase was done by the QC team, demonstrating completed features and resolved bugs, with occasional contributions from the backend team if needed.  

I was also part of a team building a government application full of complex tables and large multi-step forms, which was another new experience for me. Overall, I felt like a slightly smaller contributor in terms of business development participation. The appreciation for technical practices like code reviews was there, but with little focus from the leads. If a code review took too long and exceeded the sprint limit, it would be considered a failed sprint, so reviews had to be completed, even if they weren’t fully done and even if the sprint didn’t result in a release. That was simply the management rule.

## Glimpses from my experience

The previous section was a brief description of the environment I’m in. You might think it’s not great, perfectly normal, or even excellent and maybe I just wasn’t used to it. Personally, I don’t mind any of that.  

Let’s talk about my actual experience over this past year. Technically, I learned quite a few things:  
- I learned **RTK Query** and how to fetch data and store it asynchronously in the Redux store using **redux-thunk**.  
- I learned **Zod** and we created multiple schemas for our forms.  
- The highlight of my year was leading the migration from JavaScript to TypeScript. Even though the project isn’t fully TypeScript yet, I introduced the TS configs and we’ve been actively working on the migration.  

On top of that, the workload has been reasonable and well-balanced. Later, I was promoted to **Frontend Lead**, which I’m grateful for because it gave me more direct communication with the team leader. I could raise concerns more freely and engage in discussions to improve developer experience, code quality, and our overall environment. Thankfully, some of these suggestions were approved and implemented.

## Reflections and food for thought

Looking back on the past year, I realize things could have been a lot worse and they also could have been a lot better. Here’s what I’ve learned, and what I’ll carry forward in my career:  

1. **Know what you’re getting yourself into.**  
   Don’t rush into something without considering all aspects of it. Avoid accepting an offer instantly just because of a bigger paycheck, a “better” team, or any single factor unless you’re clearly moving out of a bad situation.  

2. **Settle in the right environment with a clear vision for growth.**  
   It’s common for software engineers to switch jobs relatively often—especially early in their careers. But over time, I’ve realized that carefully choosing a direction whether in a specific domain, a certain technology, or a type of company—can be very beneficial. It builds a clear goal, vision, and mission. Think of it as creating a brand for yourself.  

3. **Make the best of less-than-ideal situations.**  
   If you’re in a not-so-great position but it’s not toxic or full of red flags, try to improve it. Even in less-than-perfect environments, you can push for change and sometimes, things work out better than you expect.

## Final thoughts

In the end, I’m glad and thankful for the experience I’ve had. I learned what works best for me, what I don’t want in a role, and I’ve found a relatively quiet place with a balanced work pace. **Alhamdulillah.**
